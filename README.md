- How to handle multple animations on a 3D model
- How to create a basic AI, giving an NPC a basic state-machine behavior
- How to use randomness to determine autonomous behavior of a character
- How to override random behaviour with specific commands
- How to make an entity follow the player's position

**Scene Usage**

- The dog has autonomous behavior and randomly sits and stands up on its own.

- If you click the water bowl, it walks towards it and drinks.
- If you step inside the bounds of the scene, the dog follows you and sits in front of you.
